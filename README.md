# die-game

## Description

This game is played by two or players with a die of six slides. Whoever earns 50 Points wins the game. Points are scored by rolling a 2 through 6 and avoiding rolling on 1. A player can roll as many times as they want in each turn, but if they roll a 1, all the points accumulated during the turn are lost, but all the point they earned from previous turns are recorded. If a player rolls one or chooses not to continue then turn moves to the next player. After each turn, a score keeper will record each playerâ€™s score.  The final result will be displayed in readable format.
